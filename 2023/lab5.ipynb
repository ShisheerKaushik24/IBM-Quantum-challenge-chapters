    "# Challenge 5: Using 127 Qubits\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations on solving the previous challenges! You have shown that you can successfully use dynamic circuits.\n",
    "As a reward for making it this far you will be able to use one of our 127 qubit devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "As reminder, in order to earn a badge for completing the Challenge, you need to have finished 4 out of the 5 labs. We made that decision on purpose, because we know this lab will be both (a) challenging technically, and (b) using some of our most cutting edge hardware. The truth of releasing devices above 100 qubits for the public to use is that there may be significant delays in your ability to run your jobs. It's possible (although we hope not!) that you won't successfully run your job by the end of the Challenge. Please know we're doing everything possible behind the scenes to make your experience a success, but we also have a record number of participants in this year's Challenge. Be kind, and don't submit your circuits over and over which will clog the queue.\n",

    "You have seen before that working with actual physical devices brings its own set of challenges. This is even more true when you want to use a large number of qubits, since the pathways can become long, and you have to be mindful of introducing errors. We will use ibm_sherbrook as our device.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge we want you to prepare a fully entangled 127 qubit state, the so called \"GHZ-state\", in a clever way.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, we will guide you to apply your knowledge of error correction to the 127 qubit GHZ-state in order to then create a good 54 qubit GHZ-state. For this, we will use the even numbered qubits for the 54 qubit GHZ-state, which leaves the odd numbered qubits to be used as stabilizers.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: We will use the same register for the odd and even qubits, even though they will be used differently. We do this because it will make it easier to create the initial 127 qubit GHZ-state, especially when you want to optimize the depth manually.*"

    "Error correction is still an active and important research topic. So correcting errors on a real device, even in a simple case like our GHZ-state example, is not that straight forward and we want to give you the opportunity to come up with your own ideas, while giving you some guidance and hints on what potential ways could be.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: How good is the actual State?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can correct any errors, we first need to know how good the state was, and even this is not as straight forward as one might think.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way for testing how good your GHZ-state was, is to test how many of the even numbered qubits have different results from the majority. This is what you have most likely used above.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this does not necessarily mean that this also correlated with the number of errors which occurred . And one could say that the number of errors which occurred  is more important, for telling how good the GHZ-state is.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example A** to illustrate this thought: Let's say we have 10 qubits connected in a line and form a GHZ-state with them:\n",
    "\n",
    "0 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 6 - 7 - 8 - 9\n",
    "\n",
    "If we now say that error occurred  not in the readout, but when applying the entangling gate between qubit 4 and qubit 5 the output could look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "0000011111 \n",
    "\n",
    "This would be the worst possible result for the measurement \"how many qubits have the same result\".\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason a run in which more errors occurred, could actually lead to a better measure for \"how many qubits have the same result\" although most likely that state would be a lot less useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the above state would have been created and you had (working) stabilizer measurements between the qubits, you would only have the one between qubit 4 and 5 be 1. And to correct that error you could potentially just flip qubits 5-9.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a first idea on how the errors look like for your case, it might be a good idea, to look at the raw data, the results which you got from running it on the actual device, and taking into account how you built the GHZ-state.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For **Example A**  we could maybe find an error correction which would look like this:\n"

    "## Step 2: Why considering single stabilizers might not be enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the error correction exercise, we have seen that you could either use single bits, or the whole bitstring from the measurement of the stabilizer qubits in order to condition operations on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our stabilizer measurements are 54 bits long, using the whole bit strings to condition on them, is not feasible, since this would need 2^54 different bitstrings which need to be considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if we just consider single bit it might not be possible/overly complicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example B**: We have again 10 qubits connected in a line and form a GHZ-state with them:\n",
    "\n",
    "0 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 6 - 7 - 8 - 9\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we assume that we get as the measurement result 0000010000\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have stabilizer measurements in this case the one on the right of the 1 and the one on the left of the 1 would both have value 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means in this case just looking at a single stabilizer would not be enough to know that you only need to flip qubit number 5 (and no others), unless we would be ok with flipping some qubits several times, which is not ideal. \n",
    "\n",
    "So in this case it would be ideal if we could apply functions to the measurement results of the stabilizers, and use their results for as conditions in the dynamic circuits. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is possible, however, this needs to be done in Open QASM3 code, instead of in Qiskit, which will not be covered in this exercise.\n",

    "## Step 3: How not to introduce more Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different reasons which can lead to errors. Decoherence over time and errors introduced in entangling gates like the CX-Gate are two of them. Both of them can also apply to the stabilizers and we have to make sure to not introduce more noise by our attempts of correcting it, since that would beat the whole purpose. This might be less of a problem in the future, when the general error rate will go further down, but is still something which needs to be considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "What does this mean for us?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well one can think of when we want to create and measure the stabilizers. Do we unentangle them directly after they are no longer used for entangling the next qubit?  Do we wait until the whole circuit is entangled? (This of course depends on which kind of errors we might want to correct). We can also think about resetting the stabilizers and create new ones later (using the same qubits) and use 2 phases in which we try to correct errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "And we can think of what the probability is that an error occurred  from entangling a qubit (through the stabilizer) and compare it to the probability that an error is introduced in the stabilizer by unentangling it. So maybe having the stabilizers just makes it worse?\n",
    "\n",
    "When is this worth it? You can play around with the code below to get some impressions and ideas, again this is something which can change in the future, when error rates will go further down."
